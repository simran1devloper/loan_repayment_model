Here's an example of how you can write a GitHub README for your loan repayment prediction model using the LSTM-CNN technique, which you can edit and customize based on your specific requirements:

Loan Repayment Prediction Model using LSTM-CNN Technique
This repository contains a machine learning model built using a hybrid LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) approach to predict loan repayment status. The model aims to predict whether a borrower will repay a loan or default, helping financial institutions make informed lending decisions.

Project Overview
The model combines LSTM and CNN layers to predict loan repayment behavior based on a variety of borrower characteristics. LSTM handles the sequential data (e.g., payment history), while CNN is used for feature extraction to identify key trends and patterns.

Features
The model works with the following features:

Demographic Information: Age, income, marital status, etc.
Financial History: Credit score, loan history, repayment status, etc.
Loan Details: Loan amount, interest rate, term, etc.
Behavioral Data: Spending patterns, account activity, etc.
Model Architecture
The architecture consists of two key components:

LSTM Layer: This layer captures sequential patterns in data, like historical loan repayment behavior.
CNN Layer: Extracts relevant features from data patterns and trends.
Fully Connected Layers: These layers are used to classify the loan status into repayment or default.
Workflow:
Data is passed into the LSTM layer to learn temporal dependencies.
The LSTM output is processed by CNN layers for feature extraction.
Fully connected layers are used for the final classification.
Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following libraries:






Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Keras
Pandas
Numpy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
