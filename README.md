Loan Repayment Prediction Model using LSTM-CNN Technique
This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting loan repayment status using a hybrid LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) approach. The model is designed to predict whether a borrower will repay the loan or default based on historical loan data.

Project Overview
This project leverages a hybrid LSTM-CNN model for predicting loan repayment status. The model combines the power of LSTM for sequential data analysis with CNN for feature extraction. It aims to help financial institutions assess the risk of loan defaults and make informed decisions.

Features
The model takes into account the following features for prediction:

Demographic Information: Age, income, marital status, etc.
Financial History: Previous loan repayments, credit score, etc.
Behavioral Data: Spending patterns, account activity, etc.
Loan Characteristics: Loan amount, interest rate, term, etc.
Model Architecture
The model is a hybrid of LSTM and CNN layers, designed to capture both temporal and spatial dependencies in the loan data.

LSTM Layer: The LSTM layer processes the sequential nature of the data (e.g., historical loan repayment data).
CNN Layer: The CNN layer extracts important features from the data, such as trends or patterns in financial behavior.
Fully Connected Layers: After the feature extraction, fully connected layers are used to make the final prediction.
Model Flow:
Input features are preprocessed and passed into an LSTM layer to capture sequential patterns.
The output of the LSTM layer is then passed through a CNN layer for feature extraction.
The resulting features are passed through dense layers for final classification (repayment vs. default).
